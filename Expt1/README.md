Introduction - 

The Common Source (CS) configuration is a type of MOSFET configuration that is widely used as a voltage or power amplifier. The input ac small signal is supplied to the gate (G) terminal, which has a high input resistance, so as to not disturb the dc Q-point (quiescent operating point) that the circuit has been biased with to produce necessary amplification. The output is taken across the drain (D) terminal. The CS amplifier is a transconductance amplifier, i.e., if we supply voltage (V) as an input, we will obtain a current (I) as the output.

In this experiment, we have simulated a CS amplifier configuration, without a source resistance Rₛ , and performed various analysis using the LTSpice tool, a popular tool for designing, analyzing a circuit’s performance. We have made use of the TSMC 180 nm SPICE library (.lib) file to set the parameters of our N-channel MOSFET (NMOS).
